# Venture Home 

Venture Home is an online platform that allows people to list, browse listings, and book. Hosts can list their properties, whether it's a spare room, apartment, house, or even a unique space and travelers can book these books for short-term stays.

1 . Clone the Repository: First, you need to clone the GitHub repository containing the React project to your local machine. Use the following command in your terminal or Git Bash:

```javascript
git clone https://github.com/ashrafulislamakash/venture-home-mern.git
```

2. Navigate to the Project Directory: After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory using the cd command in the terminal:

```javascript
cd venture home
```

3 Install Dependencies: Once you are in the project directory, install the required dependencies using npm or yarn. In this case, we'll use npm:

```javascript
npm install
```

4 Run the Project: After the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server using the following command:

```javascript
npm run dev
```

This command will start the Vite development server, and your React project will be running locally at a default URL like http://localhost:3000/
